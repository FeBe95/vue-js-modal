# Vue.js modal (Vue 3)

Easy to use, highly customizable Vue.js modal library.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the original [`vue-js-modal`](https://github.com/euvl/vue-js-modal) by [euvl](https://github.com/euvl).
> The fork is based on the 2.0.1 branch. The `master` branch contains some new but broken functionality (slots in dynamic modals).
